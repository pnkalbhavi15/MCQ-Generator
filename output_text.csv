Energy sources  
Energy in the form of natural energy from nature can be existing as capital energy that is 
existing on the earth like fossil fuel, nuclear fuel, bio energy,kinetic energy derived from flowing 
water, potential energy derived by  stored water, wind, nuclear energy, thermal energy by 
burning coal  ( peat, lignite, an thracite and  bitumeous coal) and energy derived by celestial 
energy in the form of solar energy (electromagnetic energy of the earth’s sun), gravitational 
energy and tidal energy . 
 
Energy consumption may be consumed in the form of thermal energy, mechanical  energy or 
electrical energy.   
Total energy produced in 2019  is about   371,054.12  MW . out of which the sources is as follows 
79.8% is coming from fossil fuel (coal, petroleum and other liquids and natural gas).  These  is 
are all non renewable sources of energy. 17.3% is from renewable energy. We need to get more 
towards renewable energy  very soon. So we need to grow more in solar, wind, wave, and 
biomass energy  plants.   
 
 
 
Broad Areas of Energy Consumption:  
• Domestic Sect or –Thermal energy  for cooking food and heating, electrical energy for 
appliance like washing machine, refrigators, airconditioners, washing machines and all 
other domestic machines.  
• Transportation Sector – automobile sectors IC engines, batteries, elect rical energy for 
trains and aerospace applications  
• Agricultural Sector – tractors IC engine, electrical energy for pumps, and agricultural 
machinergy for cleaning and grinding grains,  
• Industry Sector – all kinds of industry like machine tool, automobiles , textile, food 
processers, defence, etc,.

Standard of Living:  
Nearly 25% of total energy is consumed by USA which has about 5% of worlds population, while 
India which has nearly 17% of worlds  population consumes only nearly 3.5% of worlds energy. 
We need to more machines and equipment for better living conditions. Automations improves 
better living and more accuracy in productions. Average electricity use in 2018 -2019 is 
1,181kWh per capita. T his is below the world average. Efforts to be done to use more 
machinery and automat ion to increase the comfort of people.  
 
 Energy  in physics is the capacity for doing work. It may exist in potential, kinetic, thermal, 
electrical, chemical and nuclear. Examples light  energy, heat  energy, mechanical  energy, 
gravitational energy, electrical  energy, sound  energy, chemical  energy, nuclear or atomic 
energy and so on.  
Kinetic energy is the energy in moving objects or mass. Examples include mechan ical energy, 
electrical energy etc.  Potential energy is any form of energy that has stored potential that can be 
put to future use.  
Classification of resources  
1. Based on Usability of Energy  
 a) Primary Resources  
 b) Intermediate Resources  
 c) Secondary Resources  
 
2. Based on Traditional Use  
 a) Conventional Energy  
 b) Non -conventional Energy  
 
3     Based on Long time Availability  
 a) Non - renewable Resources  
 b) Renewable Resources

4. Based on Commercial Application  
 a) Commercial Energy Resources  
 b) Non -commercial Energy Sources  
5.  Based on Origin  
Based on Utilization of Energy   
(a) Primary Resources: These are resources embodied in nature prior to undergoing any 
human made conversions (raw energy sources). Ex: sunlight, wood, wind.  
(b) Secondary Resources:  The form of energy which is finally supplied to a consumer for 
utilization is known as Secondary Resource. Ex: Electrical Energy, thermal energy (in the 
form of ste am or water)   
Conventional Energy and Non -Conventional Energy  
 
 Conventional energy  means the  energy  source which is obtained from fixed reserves in nature 
like oil, gas and coal. In other words  conventional energy  is also termed as non -
renewable  energy  sources, or fossil fuels.  
Examples :   Fossil Fuels, Coal, Gas, Oil  Nuclear (Fission): Uranium , wood,  geothermal  Hydro . 
 
Non -Conventional Energy - Energy  generated by using wind, tides, solar geothermal heat and 
biomass including farm and animal waste as well as human excreta is known as  non-conventional 
energy . All these sources are renewable or inexhaustible and do not cause e nvironment 
pollution. More over they do not require heavy expenditure.  
Example Wind , Solar: Thermal, Photovoltaic , Tidal, w ave, Bio energy  
Renewable energy and Non Renewable energy   
Renewable energy  is any  energy source  that is naturally replenished, like that derived from solar, 
wind, geothermal or hydroelectric action. The oil crisis  of 1973  began when the members of 
the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries  proclaimed an oil  embargo . Becau se of 
this the price of oil  went up sharply. Importing oil was very expensive. This was the time the 
emphasis on developing renewable energy resources began. MNRE - Ministry of New and 
Renewable Energy  (MNRE ) is the nodal ministry of the g overnment of India for all matters 
relating to new and renewable energy. The five major  renewable energy  resources are, solar, 
wind, water (hydro), b iomass and geothermal.  
 
Non -renewable resources represent  the resources which do not revive itself at a substantial 
scale, for enduring economic extraction in the specified period. These natural resources are 
available in finite quantity, which is once used, cannot be replenished.  Examples of non -
renewable resources are coal,  fossi l fuel,  crude oil, nuclear energy, etc.           UE20ME101: MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCES  2020

Environmental aspect of e nergy   
1. Trade off between energy and e nvironment . 
2. Ecology . 
3. Greenhouse Effect, Burning of fossil fuel causes green  house effect. Consequences of 
global w arming  
4. Pollution:  b urning of fossil fuel causes pollution. Various p ollutants like CO 2, SO 2 , 
nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and fine particulate matter  and their Harmful e ffects like lung 
and skin disease.  
5. Green power :  to be used as for as possible to avoid these harmful effects.

Principles of Energy Conservation  
a) Recycling of Waste .  
Examples :  recycle metals, plastics, papers etc.  
b) Modernization of technology : modern machines are energy efficient . 
c) Waste heat utilisation : waste heat in thermal power plant is used for reheating incoming 
air and steam to super heated steam.  
d) Judicial use of Proper Type of Fuel.  
e) Cogeneration  or combined heat and power  (CHP) is the use of a  heat  or power 
station  to generate electricity and usef ul heat  at the same time.   
f) Adopting Daylight Saving Time: used in western country like Europe and USA to save 
daylight during winter.  
g) Proper Operation and Maintenance : Better regular maintained machine use less power.
